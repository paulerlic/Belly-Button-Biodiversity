 # Description
   The site features several visulizations to display the belly button bacteria data. We have a bar chart to display the top 10 bacteria species, in the data set. There    is a bubble chart displaying the bacteria cultures per sample. We also have a lovley gauge chart showing the frequency at which people wash their belly buttons *fair    warning the rate at which some people wash their belly buttons is alarmingly low.
